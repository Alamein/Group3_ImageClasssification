# Nigerian Food Classification Project Documentation

## Introduction
The Nigerian Food Classification project aims to develop a deep learning model using PyTorch to classify various Nigerian food dishes. The project utilizes a dataset sourced from Kaggle containing images of different Nigerian foods, including Jollof Rice, Pounded Yam, Egusi Soup, Suya, and others. This documentation provides an overview of the project, including its objectives, dataset, model architecture, training process, and usage instructions.

## Objectives
- Develop an image classification model capable of accurately identifying various Nigerian food dishes.
- Utilize deep learning techniques, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), implemented using PyTorch.
- Train the model on a dataset consisting of images of Nigerian foods sourced from Kaggle.
- Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics and techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of images of various Nigerian food dishes collected from Kaggle. The dataset contains a total of X images belonging to Y classes, including:
- Jollof Rice
- Pounded Yam
- Egusi Soup
- Suya
- Other Nigerian food dishes

The images are organized into a directory structure where each class has its folder containing the respective images.

<!--## Model Architecture
The image classification model is based on a convolutional neural network architecture implemented using PyTorch. The model architecture consists of the following components:
- Input Layer: Accepts input images of size (3, 224, 224) corresponding to RGB images resized to 224x224 pixels.
- Pre-trained CNN Backbone: Utilizes a pre-trained CNN backbone (e.g., ResNet, VGG, etc.) to extract features from input images.
- Fully Connected Layers: Additional fully connected layers are added to the model for classification purposes.
- Output Layer: Produces output probabilities for each class using softmax activation.

## Training Process
The training process involves the following steps:
1. Data Loading: Load the dataset using PyTorch's DataLoader, applying necessary data augmentation and preprocessing techniques.
2. Model Initialization: Initialize the CNN model architecture, optionally loading pre-trained weights.
3. Model Training: Train the model on the training dataset using techniques such as mini-batch gradient descent and backpropagation.
4. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model's performance on the validation dataset, monitoring metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
5. Model Fine-tuning: Fine-tune the model as necessary based on performance evaluation results, adjusting hyperparameters and architecture if needed.
6. Model Saving: Save the trained model weights for future use and deployment.

## Usage
To use the Nigerian Food Classification model, follow these steps:
1. Clone the project repository from GitHub or download the project files locally.
2. Ensure that PyTorch and other dependencies are installed on your system.
3. Preprocess and organize your Nigerian food dataset into the required directory structure.
4. Train the model using the provided training script or notebook, specifying the dataset path, hyperparameters, and other configurations.
5. Evaluate the trained model's performance using the evaluation script or notebook, providing the path to the validation dataset.
6. Fine-tune the model based on performance evaluation results, adjusting hyperparameters and architecture if necessary.
7. Once satisfied with the model's performance, deploy it for inference on new images of Nigerian food dishes.
